    "I'm really keen on the United States presidential election of 2016 and I choosed this theme as my final homework to finish this course./I had to ditch my original plan, because as you said it's not possible to get the total likes of a facebook page at a certain time./ I would like to analyze and compare Hillary Clinton's and Donald Trump's social media activity on Facebook. My hyphothesis is that the popularity of the two nominees on Facebook, measured with likes,comments,shares are different.So instead of the total likes of the page, I'm going to scrape the facebook posts of the two nominees, Clinton and Trump. Each posts have number of likes, number of comments, number of reactions and release date. These four dimension interest me, others won't matter in this analysis. To make the posts comparable I defined the time interval of the analysis. From the election of parties presidential nominees (presidential primary elections) to the presidential election. Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presidential nominee on July 19,2016. Hillary Clinton became the Democtaric Party's presidential nominee on July 26,2016. The presidential election was on 8th of November,2016. Observation of D.Trump facebook posts: July 19,2016 - November 8,2016.Observation of H.Clinton facebook posts: July 26,2016 - November 8,2016.\n",

    "Finally the average comments per posts of the two candidates are really close to each other in the first and second interval.After average number of comments of Trump's posts went to the sky in October and November. This indicator of Trump's social media presence is almost ten times bigger in November than in July-August while in the case of Clinton it has just trippled."

    "This simple analysis shows Trump dominated the Facebook at the observed interval. In every aspect of facebook popularity (comments,likes,shares) he defeated Hillary. If we take into consideration that Clinton's facebook page had about 9-10 million likes, Trumps's facebook page had 12-13 million likes, this difference doesn't explain the significant difference between likes,comments,shares. Trump was better in almost everything on Facebook and his dominance rose near to the election day. Much more people talked,liked,shared,commented about Trump. A semantic analysis would show the \"mood\" of these reactions, but we can say the hype around Trump on Facebook and in real life was tremendous. Negatively or positively he was mentioned a lot."
